Automatically do tomos trivia for flight rising

This is a script to automatically solve tomos trivia. 
This is a replacement for copying and searching the question in the threads

To use, create a bookmark with the url:

javascript:(function(){var script=document.createElement('script');script.type='text/javascript';script.src='https://cdn.rawgit.com/cameroncros/tomostrivia/84c063c84f1e9173401cf54348e2cdde14415a19/trivia.js';document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script);})();




When you are at the trivia page, click the bookmark and it should solve the trivia page for you.

Please file a bug if it fails to work or gets the question wrong.

autobond
===========
The following is an auto bonding script, it has made some of my familiars disappear, but unsure if that was related.

javascript:(function(){var script=document.createElement('script');script.type='text/javascript';script.src='https://rawgit.com/cameroncros/tomostrivia/master/bond.js';document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script);})();

To use this, go to the choose familar page on a dragon, make sure all your familiars are in your hoard, and not attached to any other dragons. All the familiars in the "Stored Familiars" will be bonded to. 
Bonding will take a long time, and should not be interrupted to be safe.
After the first message, click OK, the familiars will start to cycle through and be bonded to. 

Do not click the OK button on the message.

If something goes wrong, a message should be popped up or the console will be popped up, you will then have to debug it yourself, or try submit a bug report if it is repeatable.

When you first get a familiar, you must manually bond with it the first time

BEWARE: THIS USES JAVASCRIPT WRITTEN BY A STRANGER. DONT USE THIS IF YOU ARE UNSURE OF WHAT YOUR DOING
